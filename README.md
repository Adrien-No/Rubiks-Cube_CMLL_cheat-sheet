Here are 42 algorithms for the CMLL step (corner orientation and permutation) at the Roux method for rubik's cube speed cubing.
They are the best for beginning according to Kian Mansour (The best (Roux) speedcuber, and many more !  : https://sites.google.com/view/kianroux/cmll)

# TODO

- add probability of each cases : https://www.reddit.com/r/rouxcubing/comments/owdo8s/cmll_statistical_distribution/

- finish naming opposite algs

- Color usual / "sexy" moves (e.g green for `U R U' R'`)

- better alignment

- design, more logical arrangment

( - correct misstakes (of english and others) )

( - a new one with more algs ? )

( - better arrangements )
